Since we recently updated our website, we have consolidated some important past news. Over the years, the most important outcome of our lab is our PhD graduates. We are so proud of them and can't wait to see what they're going to accomplish in the future! Since starting the lab in October 2016, we've had five amazing graduates: <br>
- Sophie Kim, PhD 2020 
- Jianyuan Zhai, PhD 2021 
- William Bradley, PhD 2022
- Jinhyeun Kim, PhD 2023
- Zachary Kilwein, PhD 2024

Here are some photos from their graduations:
