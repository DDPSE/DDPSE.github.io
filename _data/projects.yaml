  description: We study different hybridization scenarios for model development, including hybrid modeling and process-informed machine learning. We also use machine learning to expedite phenomenological model discovery. Read our publications on this topic, including a recent invited Perspectives article in Computer & Chemical Engineering.

  description: In this collaborative project, we build models to understand how new solids-based processing technology can be used to chemically depolymerize plastics. We start with modeling particle movement within ball mill processes, then proceed to develop an integrated flowsheet model technoeconomic and life-cycle analysis. Finally we supply chain effects of new recycling technologies. Find out more through our recent publications.

  description: Power grids must operate optimally and reliably even when contingencies occur. Power grids are large highly interconnected systems, similar to large chemical process flowsheets. Our process-informed machine learning approach enabled solutions of largescale optimization formulations of power grid operations under contingency.

  description: To expedite the wide adoption of carbon capture systems (for flue gas and direct-air capture), detailed models must be used to optimize their design and operation, so that they are economical, energy efficient and safe for communities. Our data-driven optimization tools and customized surrogate-based optimization methods have been used in collaborative projects to identify feasible and efficient design and operation of adsorption-based capture systems.
