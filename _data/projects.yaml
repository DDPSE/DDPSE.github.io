  description: We work on development of new methods and tools for global optimization with data. Data may come from expensive simulations or experiments. Our work combines machine learning and global optimization techniques such as branching and bounding to develop reliable, efficient and globally convergent methods.

  description: In this collaborative project, we build models to understand how a new solids-based processing technology can be used to chemically depolymerize plastics. We start with modeling particle movement within ball mill processes, to developing an integrated flowsheet model of the plastics recycling process, to performing technoeconomic and life-cycle analysis, to finally studying supply chain effects of new recycling technologies.

  description: Power grids must operate optimally and reliably even when contingencies occur (e.g., power-outs, weather events). Power grids are large highly interconnected systems, similar to large chemical process flowsheets. Previously, we employed our hybrid and process-informed machine learning expertise to expedite solutions of optimization problems related to power grid operations.
