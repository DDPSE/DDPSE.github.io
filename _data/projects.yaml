  description: In our DDPSE GitHub repository, you can find two tools for simulation-based optimization: DDSBB and MINOAN. Our research integrates machine learning with global optimization techniques to create reliable, efficient, and globally convergent methods. These tools enable practitioners to find improved solutions to engineering problems.

  description: We study different hybridization scenarios for model development, including hybrid modeling and process-informed machine learning. We also use machine learning to expedite phenomenological model discovery. Read our publications on this topic, including a recent invited Perspectives article in Computers & Chemical Engineering.

  description: In this collaborative project, we build models to understand how solids-based processing technology can be used to depolymerize plastics. We start with modeling particle movement within ball mill processes, then develop an integrated flowsheet model and perform technoeconomic, life cycle and supply chain analysis (see publications).

  description: Power grids are interconnected systems that must operate optimally and reliably even when contingencies occur. Our process informed machine learning approach enabled solutions of largescale optimization formulations of power grid operations under contingencies.

  description: To expedite the wide adoption of carbon capture systems (for flue gas and direct-air capture), detailed models must be used to optimize their design and operation, so that they are economical, energy efficient and safe. Our data-driven optimization tools have been used in collaborative projects to find feasible and efficient designs.
