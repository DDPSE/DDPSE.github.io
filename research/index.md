At the *Data-Driven Process Systems Engineering Lab*, we work at the intersection of methods development and real-world applications. Our research spans two key areas:
1. **Methods-Driven Research:** We develop novel approaches in data-driven optimization and hybrid modeling, integrating machine learning with fundamental process knowledge.
2. **Application-Driven Research:** We apply our methods to tackle pressing challenges in energy systems and sustainable manufacturing.
Our projects blend theoretical advancements with impactful applications to create sustainable and efficient engineering solutions.
